  "description": "Hey there, Mr. X. You have been appointed to design a railway management system like IRCTC, where users can come on the platform and check if there are any trains available between two stations. The app will also display how many seats are available between any two stations, and the user can book a seat if the availability is greater than 0 after logging in. Since this has to be real-time and multiple users can book seats simultaneously, your code must be optimized enough to handle large traffic and should not fail while doing any bookings. If more than one user simultaneously tries to book seats, only one of the users should be able to book. Handle such race conditions while booking.",
